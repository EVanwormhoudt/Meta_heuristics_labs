# Meta_heuristics_labs
My M1 metaheuristics labs

The goal of those lab works were to try to find solutions to the Traveling salesman problem without using polynomial times

Lab 1 : Permutations and exploring the whole search space \
Lab 2 : Local search\
Lab 3 : Simulated annealing\
Lab 4 and 5 : Tabu search\
Lab 6 : Population solution basedmetaheuristics\
Lab 7 : Ant colony

All of them were made in python
